# Code of Conduct

We believe that every contributor reflects the heart of Jesus when they serve others with their gifts. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants in TSC's open source projects, rooted not only in best practices—but in Scripture.

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of *Philippians 2:3*

> "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves,"

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to:

- Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for all people
- Act respectfully and graciously toward others
- Accept constructive feedback with humility
- Use our gifts to build up the Church and honor God

---

## Our Standards

In alignment with *Ephesians 4:29*

> "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up,"

We commit to:

- Using kind and uplifting language
- Being patient, especially with beginners
- Assuming the best in others
- Refraining from personal attacks, trolling, or divisive speech
- Avoiding inappropriate or offensive content
- Encouraging contributions from people of all backgrounds, skill levels, and cultures

---

## Our Responsibilities

Inspired by *Romans 12:18*

> "If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all,"

Project maintainers and OSPO leaders are responsible for:

- Clarifying and upholding this Code of Conduct
- Responding to unacceptable behavior with grace, fairness, and appropriate action
- Creating a safe, Christ-honoring space for discussion and collaboration

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind
- Use of language or imagery that is sexually explicit, violent, or hateful
- Public or private intimidation
- Sustained disruption of conversations or pull requests
- Blasphemous or theologically divisive content not aligned with TSC's mission

> *Galatians 5:22–23* reminds us:
"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control."

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code may result in warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from TSC open source projects. All reports will be handled prayerfully and confidentially by the Open Source Program Office.

## Our Motivation

We serve not to make a name for ourselves, but to lift high the name of Jesus.

> *Colossians 3:17*:
"And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him."
