## üíª Deliverables

### 1. CI Pipeline Setup

Create a comprehensive CI pipeline that:
- Runs on pull requests and main branch
- Tests both frontend and backend
- Checks code quality and style
- Reports test coverage
- Validates Docker builds

**Success Criteria:**
- Pipeline runs automatically on PRs
- All tests execute successfully
- Code quality gates are enforced
- Coverage reports are generated
- Docker images build correctly

**Hints:**
- Use matrix builds for different Node/Python versions
- Cache dependencies for faster builds
- Set up parallel test execution
- Configure proper timeout limits

### 2. Code Quality Automation

Implement automated code quality checks:
- Linting for Python and JavaScript
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning with Bandit
- SonarCloud analysis
- Dependency auditing

**Success Criteria:**
- Code style is consistently enforced
- Type issues are caught early
- Security vulnerabilities are detected
- Technical debt is tracked
- Dependencies are kept secure

**Hints:**
- Use pre-commit hooks locally
- Configure severity levels
- Set up quality gates
- Enable automated fixes

### 3. Deployment Pipeline

Create deployment workflows for:
- Development environment
- Staging environment
- Production environment
- Database migrations
- Static assets

**Success Criteria:**
- Environments are properly isolated
- Deployments are automated
- Migrations run safely
- Assets are optimized
- Rollbacks are possible

**Hints:**
- Use environment protection rules
- Implement deployment approvals
- Set up migration validation
- Configure CDN for assets

### 4. Security & Compliance

Implement security scanning and compliance:
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection
- License compliance
- SAST/DAST scanning
- Dependency updates

**Success Criteria:**
- Vulnerabilities are detected early
- Secrets are properly protected
- Licenses are compliant
- Security issues are tracked
- Dependencies are updated safely

**Hints:**
- Use Trivy for container scanning
- Configure Dependabot
- Set up GitGuardian
- Implement security gates

### 5. Monitoring & Optimization

Set up pipeline monitoring and optimization:
- Build time tracking
- Resource usage monitoring
- Cost optimization
- Cache effectiveness
- Pipeline analytics

**Success Criteria:**
- Build times are optimized
- Resources are used efficiently
- Costs are controlled
- Cache hit rates are high
- Metrics are tracked

**Hints:**
- Use build matrices wisely
- Monitor cache effectiveness
- Track build minutes
- Optimize job ordering

## üîç Final Validation

Your solution should:
1. Run reliably on every PR
2. Maintain high code quality
3. Deploy safely to production
4. Catch security issues early
5. Operate efficiently

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

1. Pipeline Failures:
   - Tests failing? Check test environment
   - Build errors? Verify dependencies
   - Timeouts? Optimize job ordering

2. Deployment Problems:
   - Secrets not working? Check environment
   - Migration failed? Validate changes
   - Assets missing? Check build process

3. Quality Issues:
   - Linting errors? Update configurations
   - Coverage low? Add missing tests
   - Security alerts? Review dependencies

4. Performance Problems:
   - Slow builds? Check caching
   - High costs? Optimize matrices
   - Resource limits? Adjust configurations
