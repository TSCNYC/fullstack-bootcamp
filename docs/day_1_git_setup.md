## üöÄ Lesson Content

### 1. Introduction to Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to:
- Track changes
- Revert to previous versions
- Collaborate with others
- Maintain different versions of your code

### 2. Git Installation

#### For macOS:
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install git

# Verify installation
git --version
```

#### For Windows:
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
2. Run the installer
3. Verify installation in Command Prompt:
```bash
git --version
```

### 3. Git Configuration

Set up your identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 4. GitHub Account Setup

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Follow the registration process
4. Set up SSH keys for secure authentication:
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Add SSH key to ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key to clipboard (macOS)
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# For Windows (PowerShell)
Get-Content ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | Set-Clipboard
```

5. Add SSH key to GitHub:
   - Go to Settings > SSH and GPG keys
   - Click "New SSH key"
   - Paste your key and save

### 5. Creating Your First Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right
   - Select "New repository"
   - Name it "fullstack-bootcamp"
   - Add a description
   - Initialize with README
   - Choose a license

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/fullstack-bootcamp.git
cd fullstack-bootcamp
```

### 6. Basic Git Commands

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# Add files to staging area
git add filename.txt
git add .  # Add all files

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 7. Working with Branches

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Switch branches
git checkout main

# List all branches
git branch

# Merge branches
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
```

## üíª Practice Exercises

1. Create a new branch called `day-1-exercise`
2. Create a file called `hello.txt` with some text
3. Commit the changes
4. Push the branch to GitHub
5. Create a pull request
6. Merge the pull request
