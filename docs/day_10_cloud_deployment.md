## üíª Deliverables

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure Setup

Set up the basic cloud infrastructure:
- Create cloud provider account
- Set up IAM users and roles
- Configure networking (VPC/VNET)
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Implement security baselines

**Success Criteria:**
- Cloud account is properly configured
- IAM policies follow least privilege
- Network is securely configured
- Monitoring is in place
- Security best practices are followed

**Hints:**
- Use infrastructure as code
- Implement proper tagging
- Set up cost alerts
- Use security groups effectively

### 2. Container Deployment

Deploy your containerized Todo application:
- Set up container registry
- Configure container orchestration
- Implement auto-scaling
- Set up load balancing
- Configure health checks

**Success Criteria:**
- Application deploys automatically
- Containers scale based on load
- Load balancer distributes traffic
- Health checks monitor status
- Deployment is zero-downtime

**Hints:**
- Use managed container services
- Implement proper logging
- Configure resource limits
- Set up container monitoring

### 3. Database Migration

Set up and migrate the production database:
- Create managed database instance
- Configure high availability
- Set up automated backups
- Implement connection pooling
- Migrate existing data

**Success Criteria:**
- Database is highly available
- Backups run automatically
- Performance is optimized
- Data is migrated successfully
- Connections are managed efficiently

**Hints:**
- Use managed database service
- Configure proper backup retention
- Set up read replicas
- Implement proper monitoring

### 4. Production Security

Implement production security measures:
- SSL/TLS configuration
- WAF implementation
- DDoS protection
- Secret management
- Security monitoring

**Success Criteria:**
- All traffic is encrypted
- WAF blocks common attacks
- DDoS protection is active
- Secrets are properly managed
- Security events are monitored

**Hints:**
- Use managed certificate service
- Configure WAF rules
- Implement rate limiting
- Use secrets management service

### 5. Performance & Cost Optimization

Optimize application performance and costs:
- Implement caching
- Configure CDN
- Optimize resource usage
- Set up cost monitoring
- Implement auto-scaling policies

**Success Criteria:**
- Application performance is optimized
- CDN serves static content
- Resources scale efficiently
- Costs are monitored
- Usage is optimized

**Hints:**
- Use managed caching services
- Configure CDN properly
- Set up resource alerts
- Implement proper scaling rules

## üîç Final Validation

Your solution should:
1. Run reliably in production
2. Scale automatically with load
3. Be secure and monitored
4. Have optimized costs
5. Follow cloud best practices

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

1. Deployment Issues:
   - Container failing? Check logs and health checks
   - Scaling problems? Review resource limits
   - Network issues? Verify security groups

2. Database Problems:
   - Connection issues? Check security groups
   - Performance slow? Review configurations
   - Backup failed? Check permissions

3. Security Concerns:
   - SSL not working? Verify certificate
   - Access denied? Check IAM roles
   - Attacks detected? Review WAF logs

4. Cost Problems:
   - Bill too high? Check resource usage
   - Waste identified? Implement auto-scaling
   - Unexpected costs? Review service usage
