   - Dependency problems: Verify package files
   - Resource constraints: Check limits

3. Networking Problems:
   - Service discovery: Check service names
   - Port conflicts: Review port mappings
   - Connection timeouts: Check network config

4. Volume Issues:
   - Data persistence: Verify mount points
   - Performance problems: Check volume types
   - Path mapping: Review bind mounts
