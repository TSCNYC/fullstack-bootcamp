## 💻 Deliverables

### 1. Testing Environment Setup

Set up comprehensive testing environments for both applications:
- Configure pytest with coverage for Flask
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Add test databases and fixtures
- Configure CI-ready test running

**Success Criteria:**
- Tests can be run with a single command
- Coverage reports are generated
- Test database is properly isolated
- CI can run the test suite

**Hints:**
- Use pytest.ini for configuration
- Set up test factories with Factory Boy
- Configure Jest in package.json
- Use separate test database

### 2. Authentication Tests

Create comprehensive tests for the auth system:
- User registration flow
- Login and token handling
- Password reset process
- Session management
- Security features

**Success Criteria:**
- All auth flows are tested
- Edge cases are covered
- Security features are verified
- Mocks are used appropriately

**Hints:**
- Use pytest fixtures for users
- Mock email sending
- Test token validation
- Check security headers

### 3. Todo CRUD Tests

Implement tests for all Todo operations:
- Create, read, update, delete
- List filtering and pagination
- Category and tag operations
- Bulk operations

**Success Criteria:**
- All CRUD operations are tested
- Edge cases are handled
- Permissions are verified
- Database state is validated

**Hints:**
- Create test data factories
- Test different user roles
- Verify database state
- Test validation rules

### 4. React Component Tests

Create tests for React components:
- Todo list and items
- Forms and inputs
- Authentication views
- Error states

**Success Criteria:**
- Components render correctly
- User interactions work
- API calls are mocked
- Accessibility is tested

**Hints:**
- Use React Testing Library queries
- Test user interactions
- Mock API responses
- Check ARIA attributes

### 5. Integration Tests

Implement end-to-end tests for key flows:
- Complete todo lifecycle
- User registration to todo creation
- Category and tag management
- Search and filter operations

**Success Criteria:**
- Key user flows are tested
- Components work together
- API integration works
- State management tested

**Hints:**
- Use pytest-playwright
- Create test scenarios
- Test real API calls
- Verify state changes

## 🔍 Final Validation

Your solution should:
1. Have >80% test coverage
2. Include both unit and integration tests
3. Run reliably in CI
4. Cover all key features
5. Have meaningful assertions

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

1. Test Setup Problems:
   - Database errors? Check isolation
   - Fixtures not working? Verify scope
   - Coverage not reporting? Check config

2. Flaky Tests:
   - Random failures? Check async code
   - State bleeding? Reset between tests
   - Timing issues? Add proper waits

3. Mock Issues:
   - API calls failing? Check mock setup
   - Side effects? Reset mocks properly
   - Wrong data? Verify mock responses

4. Integration Challenges:
   - Tests too slow? Parallelize runs
   - Resources leaking? Clean up properly
   - Random failures? Add retries
