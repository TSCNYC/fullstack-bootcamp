## üíª Deliverables

### 1. Optimized Build Pipeline

Create a multi-stage build setup for both your Flask and React applications that:
- Reduces the final image size by at least 50%
- Improves build time through effective caching
- Separates development and production builds
- Excludes development dependencies from production

**Success Criteria:**
- Final image sizes are significantly smaller than original images
- Build times are faster on subsequent builds
- Production images contain only necessary runtime dependencies
- Development experience (hot reloading, etc.) remains unchanged

**Hints:**
- Consider using `node:alpine` for React and `python:alpine` for Flask
- Look at which files trigger cache invalidation
- Think about the order of COPY commands
- Use .dockerignore effectively

### 2. Security Hardening

Implement security best practices in your Docker setup:
- Run containers as non-root users
- Implement resource limits
- Add security scanning to your build process
- Configure appropriate file permissions

**Success Criteria:**
- Containers run with minimal required permissions
- Resource limits are properly set
- Security scanning shows no critical vulnerabilities
- Files have appropriate ownership and permissions

**Hints:**
- Use `USER` directive in Dockerfile
- Look into `--security-opt` flags
- Consider using Docker Bench Security
- Review mounted volume permissions

### 3. Production Networking

Set up a production-ready networking configuration:
- Create isolated networks for frontend and backend
- Implement proper service discovery
- Configure SSL/TLS for inter-container communication
- Set up health checks

**Success Criteria:**
- Frontend can only access backend through defined API
- Services can find each other automatically
- All internal communication is encrypted
- Unhealthy containers are detected and reported

**Hints:**
- Use docker-compose networks
- Look into Docker DNS
- Consider using Traefik or Nginx for SSL termination
- Implement proper health check endpoints

### 4. Secrets Management

Implement a secure secrets management system:
- Set up Docker secrets for sensitive data
- Configure proper environment variable management
- Implement secret rotation capability
- Add audit logging for secret access

**Success Criteria:**
- No sensitive data in image layers or environment variables
- Secrets are properly encrypted at rest
- Secret rotation doesn't require container rebuild
- Access to secrets is logged and monitored

**Hints:**
- Use Docker secrets or external vaults
- Consider using .env files for development
- Look into secret rotation strategies
- Implement proper logging

### 5. Production Readiness

Make your containerized application production-ready:
- Implement proper logging
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Configure automatic restarts
- Implement backup strategies

**Success Criteria:**
- Logs are properly structured and accessible
- Key metrics are being monitored
- Containers recover automatically from failures
- Data can be backed up and restored

**Hints:**
- Look into logging drivers
- Consider using Prometheus/Grafana
- Implement restart policies
- Set up volume backup strategies

## üîç Final Validation

Your solution should:
1. Have significantly smaller image sizes (check with `docker images`)
2. Pass security scans (use Docker Scan or similar)
3. Handle network failures gracefully
4. Manage secrets securely
5. Be ready for production deployment

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

1. Build Issues:
   - Cache not working? Check layer ordering
   - Image too large? Review multi-stage setup
   - Missing dependencies? Check build stages

2. Security Problems:
   - Permission denied? Check user context
   - Vulnerability alerts? Update base images
   - Resource limits? Check container stats

3. Network Troubles:
   - Services can't connect? Check network isolation
   - DNS issues? Verify service discovery
   - SSL errors? Check certificate setup

4. Production Concerns:
   - Memory leaks? Monitor container metrics
   - Disk space? Set up log rotation
   - Backup failures? Test restore process

## üéâ Next Steps

After mastering advanced Docker:
- Study container orchestration
- Learn about monitoring
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
