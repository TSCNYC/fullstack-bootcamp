# Day 7: Authentication & Security

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this day, you will:
- Implement JWT-based authentication in your Todo application
- Add role-based access control for todo management
- Secure your API endpoints against common attacks

## üíª Deliverables

### 1. User Authentication System

Implement a complete authentication system that includes:
- User registration with email verification
- JWT-based login with refresh tokens
- Password reset functionality
- Remember me option
- Session management

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can register and verify their email
- Login generates both access and refresh tokens
- Passwords are properly hashed and salted
- Password reset works securely
- Sessions can be managed and revoked

**Hints:**
- Use Flask-JWT-Extended for token management
- Consider using Celery for email tasks
- Look into Redis for session storage
- Implement proper password validation

### 2. Role-Based Access Control

Implement RBAC for the Todo application with:
- Different user roles (Admin, Manager, User)
- Permission-based todo access
- Role hierarchy
- Dynamic permission management

**Success Criteria:**
- Different roles have appropriate access levels
- Permissions are properly enforced
- Role inheritance works correctly
- Admins can manage roles and permissions

**Hints:**
- Use Flask-Principal for permissions
- Consider using decorators for checks
- Implement role hierarchy
- Add permission caching

### 3. API Security Implementation

Secure your API endpoints against common attacks:
- Input validation and sanitization
- XSS and CSRF protection
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload security

**Success Criteria:**
- All inputs are properly validated
- Common attacks are prevented
- File uploads are secure
- Security headers are properly set

**Hints:**
- Use marshmallow for validation
- Implement proper CORS settings
- Set up CSP headers
- Use secure file upload patterns

### 4. Rate Limiting & DOS Protection

Implement rate limiting and DOS protection:
- API rate limiting by user/IP
- Burst handling
- Custom rate limit rules
- Ban system for abuse

**Success Criteria:**
- Rate limits are properly enforced
- Burst traffic is handled gracefully
- Custom rules work as expected
- Abuse is effectively prevented

**Hints:**
- Use Flask-Limiter
- Consider Redis for storage
- Implement sliding windows
- Add proper error responses

### 5. Security Monitoring & Logging

Set up security monitoring and logging:
- Security event logging
- Failed login tracking
- Suspicious activity detection
- Audit trail implementation

**Success Criteria:**
- Security events are properly logged
- Failed attempts are tracked
- Suspicious activity is detected
- Audit trail is maintained

**Hints:**
- Use structured logging
- Consider ELK stack
- Implement proper log rotation
- Add alert mechanisms

## üîç Final Validation

Your solution should:
1. Pass security scanning tools
2. Handle authentication edge cases
3. Properly enforce permissions
4. Rate limit effectively
5. Maintain proper logs

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

1. Authentication Issues:
   - Token not working? Check expiration and signing
   - Login failing? Verify password hashing
   - Session issues? Check storage configuration

2. Authorization Problems:
   - Permission denied? Check role assignments
   - Access issues? Verify permission checks
   - Role conflicts? Review hierarchy

3. Security Alerts:
   - XSS detected? Review input sanitization
   - CSRF found? Check token implementation
   - Injection possible? Verify query parameters

4. Performance Concerns:
   - Slow auth? Check token validation
   - Rate limiting issues? Review storage
   - High memory usage? Monitor caching

## üéâ Next Steps

After mastering security:
- Implement OAuth/OpenID
- Add MFA support
- Set up security monitoring
- Implement audit logging
- Consider security testing

Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time implementation. Stay updated with security best practices and regularly review your security measures.
