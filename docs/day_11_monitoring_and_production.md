## üîç Final Validation

Your solution should:
1. Provide real-time visibility
2. Enable quick troubleshooting
3. Alert on real problems
4. Support fast recovery
5. Enable continuous improvement

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

1. Metric Problems:
   - Data missing? Check collection
   - Dashboards slow? Optimize queries
   - Gaps in coverage? Review instrumentation

2. Logging Issues:
   - Logs lost? Check pipeline
   - Search slow? Optimize indices
   - Storage full? Review retention

3. Tracing Challenges:
   - Traces incomplete? Check propagation
   - Performance impact? Adjust sampling
   - Context missing? Add more spans

4. Alert Concerns:
   - Too noisy? Adjust thresholds
   - Missing issues? Review coverage
   - False positives? Refine conditions
